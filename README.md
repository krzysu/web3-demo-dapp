# Web3 Demo Dapp

## Description

## Assumptions

- in the server tests, I'm running tests against real endpoint without mocking, with a few tests that's not a problem but mustn't be abused
- DB init in test and in initializeDatabase should use ORM schema for consistency
- reuse types between client and server - use shared package
